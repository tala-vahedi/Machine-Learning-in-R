# Machine-Learning-in-R

Reading the titantic csv file and creating two supervised and predicive machine learning algorithms to perform classification tasks. The first algorithm is decision trees and the second algorithm is neural networks. Both are written in R and include a confusion matrix to evaluate the model.
